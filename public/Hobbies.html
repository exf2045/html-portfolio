        <h2>Playing Trumpet</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have been playing trumpet since I was 11 years old. Whether I am listening or performing, music is a part of me and I hope I can continue playing in the future.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I started to enjoy cooking when I started Uni. Learned very basic dishes at first, but now I am experimenting and really enjoying the act of cooking. My favorite comfort dish is spaghetti and meatballs made from scratch.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This hobby started during the pandemic. I needed to get out of the house and luckily the area I live in has many mtb riding trails. Am I any good? no, not really. But, I do enjoy being in nature. Hope I can continue my no injury streak.</li>
                </ul>
