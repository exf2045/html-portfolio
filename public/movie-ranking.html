<h1>The Three Best Movies According to Manny</h1>
<h2>My Top Three</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Stranger than Fiction</h3>
<p>
    I think the idea of finding out that someone has dictated every second of your life, and then meeting "your creator" is wild.
</p>
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>
    I mean, what a cinematic masterpiece. The soundtrack is truly one of my favorites.
</p>
<h3>IP Man</h3>
<p>
    Who doesn't love a martial arts movie? IP Man gets me hype everytime I watch it. That fight scene with the 10 black belts close to the end was monstrous.
